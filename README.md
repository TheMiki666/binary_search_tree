You have learned about binary search trees, where you take a group of data items and turn them into a tree full of nodes, with each left node being “lower” than each right node. The tree starts with the “root node” and any node with no children is called a “leaf node”. You have also learned about tree traversal algorithms like breadth-first and depth-first.

Now, let’s take a look at balanced binary search trees (BST). A BST allows fast operations for lookup, insertion, and deletion of data items.

You’ll build a balanced BST in this assignment. Do not use duplicate values because they make it more complicated and result in trees that are much harder to balance. Therefore, be sure to always remove duplicate values or check for an existing value before inserting.
